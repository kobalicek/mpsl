Disclaimer
----------

This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS that is far from being complete. MPSL is a challenging and difficult project and I work on it mostly when I'm tired of other projects. Contact me if you found MPSL interesting and want to collaborate on its development - people joining this project are very welcome.


Project Status
--------------

What is implemented:
  * [x] MPSL APIs (public) for embedding
  * [x] AST definition and source code to AST conversion (parser)
  * [x] AST-based semantic code analysis (happens after parsing)
  * [x] AST-based optimizations (constant folding and dead code elimination)
  * [x] IR concept and initial support for AST to IR mapping

What is a work-in-progress:
  * [ ] AST-To-IR translation is only basic for now (doesn't implement control-flow and many operators)
  * [ ] IR-based optimizations are not implemented yet
  * [ ] IR-To-ASM translation is very basic and buggy
  * [ ] IR is not in SSA form yet, this is to-be-researched subject atm


Introduction
------------

MPSL is a lightweight shader-like programming language written in C++. Its name is based on a sister project called [MathPresso](https://github.com/kobalicek/mathpresso), which provided the basic idea and some building blocks. MPSL has been designed to be a safe programming language that can access CPU's SIMD capabilities through a shader-like programs compiled at runtime. The language is statically typed and allows to use up to 256-bit wide variables that map directly to CPU's SIMD registers (SSE, AVX, NEON, ...).

MPSL has been designed to be lightweight and embeddable - it doesn't depend on huge libraries like LLVM, it only uses a very lightweight library called [AsmJit](https://github.com/kobalicek/asmjit) as a JIT backend. It implements its own abstract syntax tree (AST) and intermediate representation (IR) of the input program, and then uses an IRToAsm translator to convert IR to machine code.

Check out a working [mp_tutorial.cpp](./test/mp_tutorial.cpp) to see how MPSL APIs are designed and how MPSL engine is embedded and used within an application.


MPSL Types
----------

MPSL is a statically typed language where variables have to be declared before they are used like in any other C-like language. Variables can be declared anywhere and can shadow other variables and/or function arguments.

Available types:

  * `int` - 32-bit signed integer
  * `float` - 32-bit (single-precision) floating point
  * `double` - 64-bit (double-precision) floating point
  * `bool` - 32-bit boolean type (implicitly castable to any type)
  * `__qbool` - 64-bit boolean type (implicitly castable to any type)
  * All types can form a vector up to 4 elements, like `int2`, `float3`, and `double4`
  * 32-bit types can additionally form a vector of 8 elements, like `bool8`, `int8`, and `float8`

Constants are parsed in the following way:

  * If the number doesn't have any of fraction and exponent parts and it's in range [-2147483648, 2147483647] it's parsed as a 32-bit integer, otherwise it's parsed as `double`
  * If the number contains "f" suffix it's parsed as `float`
  * If the number contains "d" suffix it's parsed as `double`
  * TODO: MSPL should allow to customize which floating type is preferred (if `float` or `double`).


MPSL Features
-------------

  * Variables have to be declared before they are used:
    * `[const] type var [= value];`
    * Variables declared as `const` have to be assigned immediately and cannot be changed
    * Expressions like `int x = x;` are not allowed (unlike C), unless `x` shadows another `x` from outer scope
    * TODO: Reading a variable that was not assigned yet is undefined, should be defined

  * Typedef (aka type alias)
    * `typedef type newtype`

  * If-Else:
    * `if (cond) { taken-body; } [else { not-taken-body; }]`

  * Implicit and explicit casts:
    * `(type)expression` is an explicit cast
    * Integer and float can implicitly cast to double
    * Boolean types can implicitly or explicitly cast to any 32-bit or 64-bit type, converting `true` value to `1` and `false` value to `0`
    * Scalar is implicitly promoted to vector if used with a vector type

  * Loops:
    * `for (init; cond; iter) { body; }`
    * `do { body } while(cond);`
    * `while(cond) { body; }`

  * Functions:
    * `ret-type func([arg-type arg-name [, ...]]) { body; }`

MPSL Program
------------

A typical MPSL program has an entry-point called `main()` and uses input and output variables provided by the embedder. If `a` and `b` variables of type `float4` are provided then we can write a simple shader that returns their sum:

```c++
// Shader's entry-point - can have return value (if embedded defines it), but has no arguments.
float4 main() {
  // In case the embedder provides two arguments `a` and `b` of `float4` type.
  return a + b;
}
```

Where `a`, `b`, and a hidden return variable are provided by the embedder (including their types). This means that the same MPSL program is able to use different data layouts and different number of data arguments passed to the compiled shader.


MPSL C++ API
------------

MPSL is written in C++ and provides C++ APIs for embedders. Here is a summary of MPSL's design choices:

  * MPSL is written in C++ and exposes a simple C++ interface for embedders. It's possible to wrap it in a pure C interface, but it's not planned to be part of a MPSL project at the moment.
  * MPSL uses error codes, not exceptions, and guarantees that every failure is propagated to the embedder as an error code. MPSL never aborts on out-of-memory condition, never throws, and clean ups all resources in case of error properly.
  * MPSL has its own pooled memory allocator, which uses the OS allocator to allocate larger blocks of memory, which are then split into smaller chunks and pools. It's very fast and prevents memory fragmentation.
  * MPSL allows embedder to specify a data-layout of his own structures, which means that embedders generally don't have to change their data structures to use MPSL.

To use MPSL from your C++ code you must first include `mpsl/mpsl.h` to make all public APIs available within `mpsl` namespace. The following concepts are provided:

  * `mpsl::Context` - This is an expression's environment. A program cannot be created without having a `Context` associated. `Context` also manages virtual memory that is used by shaders.
  * `mpsl::Program[1-4]<>` - Program represents a compiled MPSL shader. The `[1-4]` is a number of data arguments passed to the shader. Here the data argument doesn't represent variables used in a shader, it represents number of "pointers" passed to the shader, where each pointer can contain variables the shader has access to.
  * `mpsl::Layout` - A layout of data arguments passed to the shader. Each data argument (or sometimes called slot) has its own `Layout` definition.
  * `mpsl::LayoutTmp<N>` - A layout that uses `N` bytes of stack before it allocates dynamic memory. Since `Layout` instances are short-lived it's beneficial to allocate them on stack.
  * `mpsl::OutputLog` - An interface that can be used to catch messages produced by MPSL parser, analyzer, optimizer, and JIT compiler.
  * `mpsl::StringRef` - A string reference, which may be used to specify string and its length. You can pass non-NULL terminated strings to all MPSL APIs.

  * `mpsl::Int[2-4]` - `int` vectors, which map to MPSL's `int[2-4]` types.
  * `mpsl::Float[2-4]` - `float` vectors, which map to MPSL's `float[2-4]` types.
  * `mpsl::Double[2-4]` - `double` vectors, which map to MPSL's `double[2-4]` types.

  * `mpsl::Error` - An error type (typedef to `uint32_t`) that is returned from MPSL APIs to report the result status.

Check out [mpsl.h](./src/mpsl/mpsl.h) for more details about class member functions and public enumerations that can be used by embedders.

Below is a minimal code that creates a simple data layout and compiles a very simple shader:

```c++
#include <mpsl/mpsl.h>

// Data structure that will be passed to the program.
struct Data {
  double a, b;
  float c;
  double result;
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  // Create the shader environment.
  mpsl::Context context = mpsl::Context::create();

  // Create the `Data` layout and register all variables that the shader has
  // access to. Special variables like `@ret` have always `@` prefix to prevent
  // a collision with valid identifiers.
  mpsl::LayoutTmp<> layout;
  layout.addMember("a"   , mpsl::kTypeDouble  | mpsl::kTypeRO, MPSL_OFFSET_OF(Data, a));
  layout.addMember("b"   , mpsl::kTypeDouble  | mpsl::kTypeRO, MPSL_OFFSET_OF(Data, b));
  layout.addMember("c"   , mpsl::kTypeFloat   | mpsl::kTypeRO, MPSL_OFFSET_OF(Data, c));
  layout.addMember("@ret", mpsl::kTypeDouble  | mpsl::kTypeWO, MPSL_OFFSET_OF(Data, result));

  // This is our shader-program that will be compiled by MPSL.
  const char body[] = "double main() { return sqrt(a * b) * c; }";

  // Create the program object and try to compile it. The `Program1<Data>` means
  // that the program accepts one data argument of type `Data`. You can just use
  // `Program1<>` if you want the argument untyped (void).
  mpsl::Program1<Data> program;
  mpsl::Error err = program.compile(context, body, mpsl::kNoOptions, layout);

  if (err) {
    printf("Compilation failed: ERROR 0x%08X\n", static_cast<unsigned int>(err));
  }
  else {
    Data data;
    data.a = 4.0;
    data.b = 16.0;
    data.c = 0.5f;

    err = program.run(&data);
    if (err)
      printf("Execution failed: ERROR 0x%08X\n", static_cast<unsigned int>(err));
    else
      printf("Return=%g\n", data.result);
  }

  // RAII - `Context` and `Program` are ref-counted and will
  // be automatically destroyed when they go out of scope.
  return 0;
}
```

More documentation will come in the future.
